    <h1 class="Header">Australian Bridge Duels</h1> 
    <h3 class="TheBridge1"> The Bridge is a minigame that requires a lot of skill and timing, Your objective is to
        get into the other teams goal before they do, the game is quite similar to 'Capture the Flag' but their are multiple 
        different offence and defence strategies that you can use. 
    </h3>
    <h3 class="TheBridge2"> The annoying thing about Bridge Duels is that Ping / Internet Speed drastically effects your 
        gameplay, and when Hypixel (The Main Bridge Server) is hosted in North America and there are people in Oceania with 
        200 ping, The Oceanic Reigion is put at a disadvantage. Thats why we are creating Bridge Duels in Australia to give 
        different Australians the chance of having 0 ping that no other server offers, the server will be up 24/7 and will be
        given constant updates. Me and my team are very community driven and will have a discord and a subreddit for new ideas
        that we can add. We're not limmiting ourselves to just The Bridge though, we will have Bedwars 1v1's, Skyblock, 
        UHC, Sumo and more. If you would like to support us, their will be a mod / staff forum up soon and a donation page up 
        soon as well.

        a page will be up soon
